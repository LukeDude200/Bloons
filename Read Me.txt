You will not be able to run this program yourself since it needs external applications
Video included showing the GA start running to prove it works

General Things we did:
Learn how to screenshot with Python (Setting up grid + death screen for game)
Did image manipulation (For the death screen to be more clear)
Learned how to read off of screen with tesseract (Read the death wave off the death screenshot)
Learned how to interact with a window screen (Make game in focus, placing towers and starting enemies)
Made the GA utilize multiple mutations, including the ability to do multiple at a time
Did multiobjective (Death wave - Towers Placed)
Did population re-initialization (Every 4th gen, reset aside from best)
Did elitism (Both for re-initialization and per generation)
Added ability to start from already made builds (Builds stored in pickle files can be read from to continue generating)
Reduced the search space through introducing tower sections (Lead towers, camo towers, all towers)
